AquaSafe - 2021

## Project information

This project is a submission for the PA Media and Design competition.
AquaSafe was made to provide more information to anyone who needs to test water and provide more information on water safety.
It was not made as an accurate lab-style testing service, and should not be used as such.

You can find all of the code files under the lib folder which includes a folder for any pseudo code we have completed.
Not all pseudo code may be provided there as there is a lot of script to write in that regard, it will be added in the future whenever the developers are able to.

Developed by Ian Timchak and Alex Brow
